# CKAD ANNOTATIONS

This repo contains my personal annotations for Certified Kubernetes Application Developer(CKAD). I may not take this certification, but be declared here that I've took all steps to prepare for it. 

My intention is to get Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification, and this is the first step to get there.
